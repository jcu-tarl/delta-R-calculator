  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>
    182 Records of ΔR measurements containing &delta;<sup>18</sup>O and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values and Lat-Long
    coordinates were processed. The distribution of sites is shown in Fig. 1.

    Method and results
  </h2>
  <p>
    The intention was to model the ΔR values on location and other parameters. Given that site locations form a
    near continuous loop around the coast, for the purposes of the model, the latitude and longitude were converted to
    polar coordinates about the centre of the continent, so that the bearing formed a continuous loop with a period of
    360°.

    Bearing and distance were calculated for each data point from the central point with coordinates 134 East, 24 South.
    Great Circle distance was calculated using the Haversine Formula, where

    &Phi;<sub>2</sub> and &Phi;<sub>1</sub> are the destination and starting point latitudes, and &lambda;<sub>2</sub>
    and &lambda;<sub>1</sub> the corresponding longitudes. The radius $r$ of the spherical geoid model was taken to be 6,371 km. The
      angle $\theta$
      used was the starting bearing from central point to traverse the distance path, calculated as

  <h3>
    Models
  </h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of the modelling was to create a tool to predict $\Delta $R values at any point around the coast, in
    situations where both, one or neither of $\delta ^{18}$O and $\delta ^{13}$C were known. For this reason, four
    models were run, using:
  <ol>
    <li>All parameters</li>
    <li>All except $\delta ^{18}$O</li>
    <li>All except $\delta ^{13}$C</li>
    <li>Location only</li>
  </ol>
  Simple linear models with some interactions between the variables were used. The following four tables show the model
  formulae and results summaries.

  <h2>
    Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
    An R$^2$ value of 0.69 for the full model was considered reasonable. Although it can be argued that a model using
    location as a predictor can always be manipulated to compliance, given sufficient complexity and a measure of
    over-fitting, the fact that varied data existed in the same locations that were distinguished by their $\delta
    ^{18}$O and $\delta ^{13}$C values alone, lends some weight to the observed R$^2$ value. What should also be
    considered is the fact that the purpose of the exercise was to produce a tool to predict $\Delta $R values within
    the domain of observed $\Delta $R values. Fig. 2 shows predicted $\Delta $R against measured $\Delta $R for all
    sites using the full model.

    Predicted $\Delta $R values for both the full model and the location-only model are shown in Fig. 3, in the context
    of location.

  <p>
    Model coefficients and variance-covariance matrices corresponding to each of the models were formed into javascript
    multi-dimensional arrays, which were configured to calculate a $\Delta $R prediction with and without either of the
    $\delta ^{18}$O and $\delta ^{13}$C values, using the resultant models.
