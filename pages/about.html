    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Studies of pre-bomb molluscs live-collected around the Australian coastline have concluded that
      near-shore marine radiocarbon reservoir effects are small and relatively uniform.
      These studies are based on limited samples of sometimes dubious quality representing only selective
      parts of Australia’s lengthy coastline.</p>
      <p>We systematically examine spatial variability in the marine
      reservoir effect (ΔR) through analysis of 292 live-collected mollusc samples across the Australian
      mainland coasts and near-shore islands subject to strict selection criteria. This study presents
      233 new ΔR values combined with an evaluation of 59 previously published values.</p>
      <p>Results demonstrate significant spatial variability in marine radiocarbon reservoir effects across
      the study region. ΔR values range from 68±24 14C years off the Pilbara region of Western Australia
      to -337±46 in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria in Queensland. Most sets of local values exhibit
      internal consistency, reflecting the dominant influence of regional oceanography, including depletion
      in ΔR values southwards along the eastern Australian coastline coincident with the East Australian
      Current. Anomalous values are attributed to inaccurate documentation, species-specific relationships
      with the carbon cycle and/or short-term fluctuations in marine radiocarbon activities.</p>
      <p>To account
      for the heterogeneous distribution of marine 14C, we recommend using a regionally specific ΔR value
      calculated using the Australian ΔR Calculator, available at: https://delta-r-calc.jcu.io/.</p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      Kriging, a Gaussian process regression, was used to interpolate ΔR values around the Australian coast,
      using Python tools from the SciKit GStat package (Mälicke et al. 2021). Different models were fit against the variogram data,
      with the spherical variogram returning the lowest error chosen. A semi-variogram was produced by plotting the semi-variance against
      lag for the point pairs in the data set. The spherical model was applied to the kriging function and kriging was performed for all
      pixels with a size of 10 km within a rectangular region bounding the Australian mainland and Tasmania. The Australian Equal Albers
      projection EPSG:3577 was adopted to minimise distortion. Results were masked to a 300 km border around the coast. The outputs resulted
      in two raster images, one representing the kriged ΔR values, and the other the Error Variance, of which the square root represents the
      standard error of the interpolation process. To account for both the standard errors of the original ΔR measurements, and those of the
      interpolation process, a further interpolation of measurement standard errors was performed, creating a measurement standard error surface.
      The two error surfaces were combined by taking the square root of the sum of their squares to produce an overall standard error surface.
