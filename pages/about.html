    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      192 Records of ΔR measurements containing &delta;<sup>18</sup>O and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values and Lat-Long
      coordinates were processed. The distribution of sites is shown in Fig. 1.

    <h2>Method and results</h2>
    <p>
      The intention was to model the ΔR values on location and other parameters. Given that site locations form a
      near continuous loop around the coast, for the purposes of the model, the latitude and longitude were converted to
      polar coordinates about the centre of the continent, so that the bearing formed a continuous loop with a period of
      360°.

      Bearing and distance were calculated for each data point from the central point with coordinates 134 East, 24

    <h3>Models</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of the modelling was to create a tool to predict &Delta;R values at any point around the coast, in
      situations where both, one or neither of &delta;<sup>18</sup>O and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C were known. For this
      reason, four models were run, using:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>All parameters</li>
      <li>All except &delta;<sup>18</sup>O</li>
      <li>All except &delta;<sup>13</sup>C</li>
      <li>Location only</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Simple linear models with some interactions between the variables were used. The following four tables show the
      model formulae and results summaries.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      An R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.65 for the full model was considered reasonable. Although it can be argued that a
      model
      using location as a predictor can always be manipulated to compliance, given sufficient complexity and a measure
      of
      over-fitting, the fact that varied data existed in the same locations that were distinguished by their
      &delta;<sup>18</sup>O
      and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values alone, lends some weight to the observed R<sup>2</sup> value. What should also be
      considered is the fact that the purpose of the exercise was to produce a tool to predict &Delta;R values within
      the domain of observed &Delta;R values. Fig. 2 shows predicted &Delta;R against measured &Delta;R for all
      sites using the full model.

      Model coefficients and variance-covariance matrices corresponding to each of the models were formed into
      javascript
      multi-dimensional arrays, which were configured to calculate a &Delta;R prediction with and without either of the
      &delta;<sup>18</sup>O and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values, using the resultant models.

	Note that the errors shown represent the standard error based on covariances within the described model alone, assuming zero measurement errors.
    </p>
    <p>
    Actually the measured &Delta;R values had an average standard error of 60 years.</br>
      The measured &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values had an average standard error of 0.49.</br>
	The measured &delta;<sup>18</sup>O values had an average standard error of 0.28.
    </p>
    <p>
	The errors associated with the measurement of &Delta;R (averaging &plusmn;60 years) are not included in the stated standard errors.  It is generally accepted that measurement errors of the dependent variable do not affect the coefficients of a linear model, if it can be assumed that the measurement errors have an expected value of zero.  Such errors may have had an adverse effect on the ability to establish the statistical significance of the model.
