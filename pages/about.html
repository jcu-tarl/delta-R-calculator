    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Studies of pre-bomb molluscs live-collected around the Australian coastline have concluded that
      near-shore marine radiocarbon reservoir effects are small and relatively uniform.
      These studies are based on limited samples of sometimes dubious quality representing only selective
      parts of Australia’s lengthy coastline.</p>
      <p>We systematically examine spatial variability in the marine
      reservoir effect (DR) through analysis of 292 live-collected mollusc samples across the Australian
      mainland coasts and near-shore islands subject to strict selection criteria. This study presents
      233 new ΔR values combined with an evaluation of 59 previously published values.</p>
      <p>Results demonstrate significant spatial variability in marine radiocarbon reservoir effects across
      the study region. DR values range from 68±24 14C years off the Pilbara region of Western Australia
      to -337±46 in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria in Queensland. Most sets of local values exhibit
      internal consistency, reflecting the dominant influence of regional oceanography, including depletion
      in ΔR values southwards along the eastern Australian coastline coincident with the East Australian
      Current. Anomalous values are attributed to inaccurate documentation, species-specific relationships
      with the carbon cycle and/or short-term fluctuations in marine radiocarbon activities.</p>
      <p>To account
      for the heterogeneous distribution of marine 14C, we recommend using a regionally specific ΔR value
      calculated using the Australian ΔR Calculator, available at: https://delta-r-calc.jcu.io/.</p>
